    I am a Research Associate in Statistics at the [department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) of [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu). I currently live in [Durham](https://g.page/DukeUniv?share), a relatively small city in North Carolina, USA.

    My [<mark>complete curriculum vitae</mark>](/files/cv_Rigon.pdf) is available at [this link](/files/cv_Rigon.pdf). For more information about myself, you can also visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/tommasorigon) and [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=vRRVHqgAAAAJ&hl=en) profiles.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in Bayesian methods for the analysis of complex data, covering the theoretical, applicative, and computational aspects. I try to balance these three areas in my research projects and I appreciate all of them. For example, during my Ph.D. at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/) I studied novel methods to approximate Bayesian nonparametric priors, which are flexible and increasingly popular probabilistic tools. In a different project, I studied novel Bayesian models to conduct functional clustering in a marketing applications. I am also intrigued by the computational aspects of Bayesian statistics, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational approaches. Some of my works are based on the novel Polya-gamma data-augmentation.
